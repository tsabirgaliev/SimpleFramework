== Homework 1

Complete the `framework.Main.main()` method such that the web-server will
work as a calculator.

=== Example

Request:

 http://localhost:8080/?a=5&b=3&op=-

Response:

 a = 5.0
 b = 3.0
 op = -
 result = 2.0

NOTE: Remember, that some symbols (like `=`, `+`, `&`) are reserved, so you can't pass `+` for op.
You will have to _encode_ them: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding
